This was a study project about using USB shield code with Arduino. The 2 sample files are not libraries. Each Arduino code file is a self contained USB sample of how to setup and use USB 1.0, one file UsbMax3421with3BMouse_v1a.ino is for reading a standard 3 button mouse, the second file UsbMax3421withCM15a_v1a.ino is a 2 way USB sample using a CM15a X10 interface.
