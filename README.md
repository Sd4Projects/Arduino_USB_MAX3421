This was a study project about using USB shield code with Arduino. The 2 sample files are not libraries. Each Arduino code file is a self contained USB sample of how to setup and use USB 1.0 with the max3421 chip, one file UsbMax3421with3BMouse_v1a.ino is for reading a standard 3 button mouse, the second file UsbMax3421withCM15a_v1a.ino is a 2 way USB sample using a CM15a X10 interface. Do not include other USB libraries with these sample files.

The KiCad sample files are for USB MAX3421 shield using an Arduino Zero 3.3 volt system. Amazon/eBay should have Arduino UNO shields that use the MAX3421 chip, they should work with the sample code.
